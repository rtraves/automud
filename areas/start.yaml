    title: Sunlit Shoreline
    description: |
      Your vision blurs as you stir from unconsciousness. Saltwater stings your nostrils, and the sound of crashing waves fills your ears.
      As your eyes adjust, you see the remnants of a ship scattered around, half-buried in the sands. Survivors, both human and creature, 
      are scattered along the coastline, struggling to make sense of the chaos. A pathway to the north seems to lead into a dense jungle.
      To the west, a steep cliff rises, providing a vantage point.

    title: Jungle's Edge
    description: |
      Dense trees and thick foliage mark the entrance to the jungle. The calls of unseen birds and creatures echo throughout. The path splits into two: one to the east, which seems to lead deeper into the jungle, and one to the west, where a faint trail of smoke rises, hinting at civilization.

      A makeshift camp has been set up here by survivors of the shipwreck. A small fire crackles in the center, around which survivors share stories and resources. This may be a temporary respite, but for now, it's a haven.
