weird bugs: 
- start with fishing only
- can spam actions
    - actions will be automated 
    - when action performed set autoState
    - until stop command action will perform 
    - if another action command is recieved change action
    - proccess other commands normally



DONE: setup game manager automation methods and map
DONE: add logic into the handlecommand to work with these functions
Next: stop cauto command on player quit and dc 
Next: create a stop auto command
